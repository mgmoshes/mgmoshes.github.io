## Introduction

People learn things for different reasons.

The reasons depend both on the people doing the learning and the things being learnt

When beginning a learning journey, after getting past the why we are landed with the `how`

In this post we'll go over the pros and cons of three different methods for learning

- Books

- Video Lectures

- MOOC

- Tutorials

## Books

Books are good because

- Provides a medium which allows finegrained control over the pace of learning
- Provides complete coverage  a subject
- Orderly and methodological progress of material

There's a satisfcation in hunting after the perfect book. A sense of accomplishment when you've got the perfect one.

However the feeling it supplies is an illusion of progress, which is detrimental to the final goal of actually learning the thing.

## MOOC

MOOCs have the advantages of
- Structure
- Obligation
- Community
- Certification

The MOOC has the potential to be more structured.
To contain more suited and curated exercises which allows you to be led by the hand to where 
the instructors want you to get to.

The main disadvantage is that you are handicapped and tied to the format
Unable to help yourself to the knowledge. Someone needs to spoon feed it to you.

### Tutorials

Are sufficient for mainly one purpose,
helping complete a  given task. You probably won't learn much by reading through a tutorial. And unless you have the opportunity to use the material immediatly you probably won't remember it.
